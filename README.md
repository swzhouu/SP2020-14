PRIVACY-PRESERVING BASED ACCESS CONTROL FOR  HEALTH INFORMATION NETWORK
## Introduction
As technology is currently evolving, the way to communicate is also increasing
which makes it easier to violate personal information right. Medical information is
considered to be one of the information that has been violating the patient’s personal
information right. Medical information is a record that keeps all the patient’s
information, patient’s treatment history, patient’s disease along with the patient’s family
information as well. It is considered to be important information for patient treatment
and in the law area as well. In most of the hospitals, the patients do not have any
authorization to access their medical information but all of the medical staff have access
to their medical information even though the patient did not give any consent for them
to be able to read the information. Moreover, the patient may not have treatment with
only one hospital. It means that the patient’s information will be scattered and it will be
hard to update all the medical information. Also, it will be hard for the patient when
they need to ask for the medical information from one hospital and bring it to another
hospital which they have to do by themselves.
